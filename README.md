# VerbwireHackathon
Mint NFTs across 13 chains in seconds with VerbMint! 

VerbMint allow anyone regardless of technical skills to chat with our AI-driven LLM assistant to perform blockchain state changes, such as minting NFTs through text across 13 different blockchains in under 30 seconds.

We also trained our LLM to answer questions about Verbwire and Web3 seamlessly through the chat interface.

#### Disclaimer: My team created a prototype NFT minting chatbot for TreasureHacks 3.5, but it only supported 1 chain and had no File Hosting features nor Verbwire specific Q&A feature. All the demos shown are work done during the hackathon.
